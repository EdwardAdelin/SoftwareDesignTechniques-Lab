# SDT Lab Repo

This repo has the SDT labs from 4th year, 1st semester.



## IMPORTANT

Go in `lab7` folder and read the Readme.md file.
You will see there how to run the final lab, lab nr 7 (lab 7 includes progres of all microservices things done).

Thus being said, lab7 Readme.md is the main Readme for this repo.

* OBS: Running lab 7 is like running all the microservices labs together, so you don't need to run labs separately.

`HAVE FUN! :)`
